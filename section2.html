            <strong>Hey there!</strong> 😊<br><br>
            As the year comes to an end, I want to take a moment to say something that’s been on my mind: <strong>I’m sorry</strong> for everything I’ve done that hurt you this year.<br>
            I know I wasn’t the best version of myself, and I deeply regret it. I miss you more than words can express, but I understand there’s no going back now.<br>
            From the depths of my heart: <strong>Sorry.</strong> I know no amount of apologies will ever be enough. 💔

        <div class="section2_text">
            I made this to share my side of the story, hoping to offer some clarity.<br>
            If you’ve ever wondered why I became so difficult to be around, there were reasons. My past has left scars, and the environment I worked in only added to it.<br>
            I know these don’t justify my actions, but I hope it helps you understand a part of me. 🌱

        <div class="section2_text">
            I truly wish you the best in life. May you find happiness, love, and support from people who deserve you.<br>
            It’s time for me to say goodbye, and with that, I’m signing off.<br>
            Take care, and may your future be filled with joy and positivity—far away from the toxicity I brought into your life. ❤️..
